<div class="lake_text">
    <p>A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that
    serves to feed or drain the lake.[1] Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, although like the much larger
    oceans, they form part of earth's water cycle. Lakes are distinct from lagoons which are generally coastal parts of the
    ocean. They are generally larger and deeper than ponds, which also lie on land, though there are no official or
    scientific definitions.[2] Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing in a channel on
    land. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.</p>
    <p>
    Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation. Other lakes are
    found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers, where a river channel has widened into a basin. In some
    parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes
    are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing
    them.</p>
    <p>
    Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or
    domestic water supply, or for aesthetic, recreational purposes, or other activities.

<div class="forest_text">
    <p>A forest is an area of land dominated by trees.[1] Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world,
    incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing and ecological function.[2][3][4] The
    Food and Agriculture Organization defines a forest as land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5
    meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include
    land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.[5] Using this definition FRA 2020 found that forests
    covered 4.06 billion hectares or approximately 31 percent of the global land area in 2020 but are not equally
    distributed around the globe.[6]</p>
    <p>
        Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are distributed around the globe.[7] More than half of the
        world’s forests are found in only five countries (Brazil, Canada, China, Russian Federation and United States of
        America). The largest part of the forest (45 percent) is found in the tropical domain, followed by the boreal, temperate
        and subtropical domains.[8]
    </p>
    <p>
        Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant
        biomass. Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate
        forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.[7]
    </p>
    <p>
        Forests at different latitudes and elevations, and with different precipitation and evapotranspiration[9] form
        distinctly different biomes: boreal forests around the North Pole, tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests
        around the Equator, and temperate forests at the middle latitudes. Higher elevation areas tend to support forests
        similar to those at higher latitudes, and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Almost half the forest area (49 percent) is relatively intact, while 9 percent is found in fragments with little or no
        connectivity. Tropical rainforests and boreal coniferous forests are the least fragmented, whereas subtropical dry
        forest and temperate oceanic forests are among the most fragmented. Roughly 80 percent of the world’s forest area is
        found in patches larger than 1 million hectares. The remaining 20 percent is located in more than 34 million patches
        across the world – the vast majority less than 1 000 hectares in size.[10]
    </p>
    <p>
        Human society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways.[11] Forests provide ecosystem
        services to humans and serve as tourist attractions. Forests can also affect people's health. Human activities,
        including unsustainable use of forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.[citation needed]

<div class="tuorism_text">
    <p>Cultural and natural heritage are in many cases the absolute basis for worldwide tourism. Cultural tourism is one of the
    megatrends that is reflected in massive numbers of overnight stays and sales. As UNESCO is increasingly observing, the
    cultural heritage is needed for tourism, but also endangered by it. The "ICOMOS - International Cultural Tourism
    Charter" from 1999 is already dealing with all of these problems. As a result of the tourist hazard, for example, the
    Lascaux cave was rebuilt for tourists. Overtourism is an important buzzword in this area. Furthermore, the focus of
    UNESCO in war zones is to ensure the protection of cultural heritage in order to maintain this future important economic
    basis for the local population. And there is intensive cooperation between UNESCO, the United Nations, the United
    Nations peacekeeping and Blue Shield International. There are extensive international and national considerations,
    studies and programs to protect cultural assets from the effects of tourism and those from war. In particular, it is
    also about training civilian and military personnel. But the involvement of the locals is particularly important. The
    founding president of Blue Shield International Karl von Habsburg summed it up with the words: “Without the local
    community and without the local participants, that would be completely impossible”.[54][55][56][57]</p>

<div class="adventure_text">
    <p>
        An adventure is an exciting experience that is typically bold, sometimes risky, undertaking.[1] Adventures may be
        activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba
        diving, river rafting or participating in extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological
        arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained in a risky
        manner.
